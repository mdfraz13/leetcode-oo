Storage of solutions for leetcode problems 

## Introduction

This repository contains a list of [leetcode](leetcode.com/) solutions.

## Motivation 

There are plenty of github repositories with solutions by a lot greet developers. Why another one ?
Well most of solutions were written with no readability in mind. I was not able to find a single repository where author wrote
readable code with comments and test. Moreover, all solutions don't follow to any code conventions [checkstyle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html)

## Principles 

Each implementation in this repository follows code conventions configured in [checkstyle.xml](https://github.com/strogiyotec/leetcode-oo/blob/master/checkstyle.xml)
and each implementation has tests written using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)


| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| 3 |Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters| [Java](https://github.com/strogiyotec/leetcode-oo/blob/master/src/main/java/leetcode/oo/sliding/window/SlidingWindowUniqueCharsLength.java)| Medium| 
| 30|Substring with Concatenation of All Words| [Java](https://github.com/strogiyotec/leetcode-oo/blob/master/src/main/java/leetcode/oo/sliding/window/AllWordsSubstring.java)| Hard|
|76 |Minimum Window Substring| [Java](https://github.com/strogiyotec/leetcode-oo/blob/master/src/main/java/leetcode/oo/sliding/window/LongestUniqueSubString.java)| Hard|
|239|Sliding Window Maximum| [Java](https://github.com/strogiyotec/leetcode-oo/blob/master/src/main/java/leetcode/oo/sliding/window/MaxSlidingWindow.java)|Hard|
